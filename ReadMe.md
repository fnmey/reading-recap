# Notion's Reading Recap

## Motivation
As a reading enthusiast the use of an E-Book-Reader comes in handy in terms of handling and less waste of resources. On the other hand, putting your analog books back in your shelf, where you can eye what you've archived is a feeling, that is not replaceable. The notion workspace is perfect for organizing your digital book shelf and brings the possibility to export your data.
That in turn gives us the option to analyse your reading behavior and highlight interesting facts with Python and its powerful libraries.
