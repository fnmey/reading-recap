# Notion's Reading Recap

  

## Motivation

The notion workspace is perfect for organizing things such as read books and works well as 'digital bookshelf'. There is also the option to export the data as csv.
<br>
With Python and its powerful Pandas library we are able to analyse this data and create graphics on our reading behavior.
